# My Webpage

**Date Created:** 10/2/2025

## Overview

I'm kind of thinking I need a website. Nothing too complicated. Don't need to reinvent the wheel.

**Update** 10/10/2025

Keeping it modular. Crashed out a bit last night but feeling recharged. I like the idea of a contact page but have no clue how to do that...yet. But at least I can build a form to start with.

## What’s here so far
- `index.js` — the main thing that swaps screens
- `modules/` — small bits (home, header, sidebar). breaking it up so I don’t lose track
- `data/videos.json5` — my video list. 
- `style/` — nothin yet. kinda feel like the module logic comes first.
- `templates/index.html` — the HTML template webpack builds from
